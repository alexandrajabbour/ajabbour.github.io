<h2>Dissertation</h2>

<p>My dissertation seeks to advance existing knowledge on public opinion formation by answering two questions. First, which aspects of geographic contexts influence citizens’ perception of the national economy? Second, under which conditions and for whom does the local context become salient to citizens in order to form an opinion about the national economy?</p>
