My dissertation seeks to advance existing knowledge on public opinion formation by answering two questions. First, which aspects of geographic contexts influence citizens’ perception of the national economy? Second, under which conditions and for whom does the local context become salient to citizens in order to form an opinion about the national economy?

*In progress* </summary>

 A growing number of studies investigate the role of local factors on individuals' political stances. Some of those studies showed that individuals use local economic conditions to infer the state of the national economy. What remains unknown is the extent to which individual mobility mitigates the impact of the local economic conditions on the perception of the national economy. The aim of this study is to demonstrate that when considering the impact of the local economic context on the perception of the national economy, it is necessary to take into account the mobility between the two places where citizens tend to spend most of their time: home and work. To do so, I use large administrative data from the US census bureau tapping the origin (residential area) and destination (workplace) of citizens and surveys on political preferences retrieved from the Cooperative Congressional Election Survey to measure the perception of the national economy. By means of this study, I aim to contribute to the literature on local politics and economic voting by giving a more complete picture of the context in which an individual lives and the effect of this specific environment on economic perception.
