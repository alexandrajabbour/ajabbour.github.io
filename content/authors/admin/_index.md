I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at the Université de Montréal (Canada) under the supervision of [Ruth Dassonneville](https://www.chairedemocratie.com/members/dassonneville-ruth/).  I do research at the intersection of political behavior, geography and economy. My dissertation explores the role of local factors on citizens’ assessments of the nation’s economic performance. I am funded by the Fond de recherche du Québec Société et Culture (FRQSC). 

I am also interested in questions on representation, group identity, the political consequences of housing markets and the congruence between citizens and political parties. Methodologically, I have a keen interest for causal inference, experimental methods in social sciences and smart identification strategies.

I am currently a research fellow at the [Canada Research Chair in Electoral Democracy](https://www.chairedemocratie.com) led by Ruth Dassonneville and affiliated with the [Center for the Study of Democratic Citizenship](https://csdc-cecd.ca).
