<p>I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at the Université de Montréal (Canada) under the supervision of Ruth Dassonneville. I do research at the intersection of political behavior, geography and economy. My dissertation explores the role of local factors on citizens’ assessments of the nation’s economic performance. I am funded by the Fond de recherche du Québec Société et Culture (FRQSC).

I am also interested in questions on representation, group identity, the political consequences of housing markets and the congruence between citizens and political parties. Methodologically, I have a keen interest for causal inference, experimental methods in social sciences and smart identification strategies.

I am currently a research fellow at the Canada Research Chair in Electoral Democracy led by Ruth Dassonneville and affiliated with the Center for the Study of Democratic Citizenship.</p>
